/*1. Create a “groceries list” array. Each element of 
the array is an object that contains the name of a 
product, an amount needed and a property saying 
whether it is bought or not. Write a few functions
for working with this array: 
1) Function for displaying the entire list; 
2) Function for adding a purchase to the list. 
Note that if a product already exists in the array,
the amount needs to be increased in the existing 
purchase, not in a new one; 
3) Function for purchasing a product. The function 
accepts the name of a product and marks it as bought.*/
